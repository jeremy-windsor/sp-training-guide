# Theory Expansion Plan

> Living document. Update as sections are completed or scope changes.

## Goal

Add protocol theory files to each section that covers a protocol or mechanism. The existing design/deployment files tell you *what to do*. Theory files tell you *why it works* — protocol internals, packet formats, state machines, algorithms, and RFCs.

## File Convention

Each section that gets a theory file follows this naming:

```
<section-name>-theory.md    — protocol mechanics (markdown)
<section-name>-theory.mp3   — TTS audio of theory content
```

These sit alongside the existing 4-file set:

```
modules/XX-topic/
  X.Y-section-name.md              ← design/deployment (existing)
  X.Y-section-name.mp3             ← design audio (existing)
  X.Y-section-name-theory.md       ← protocol theory (NEW)
  X.Y-section-name-theory.mp3      ← theory audio (NEW)
  X.Y-section-name-answers.md      ← Q&A (existing)
  X.Y-section-name-answers.mp3     ← Q&A audio (existing)
```

## Theory File Template

Every theory file follows this structure:

```markdown
# X.Y — [Topic] — Protocol Theory

## Protocol Overview
- What problem it solves
- Where it sits in the stack (L2/L3/control plane/data plane)
- Historical context (when created, why, what it replaced)

## Core Mechanisms
- State machines / FSMs (with state descriptions)
- Packet/PDU formats (field-by-field breakdown)
- Algorithms (SPF, best path, election, etc.)
- Timers and their defaults (with rationale)

## Key RFCs & Standards
- RFC XXXX — [title] — what it defines
- Organized by importance, with brief description of each

## Protocol Interactions
- How it interacts with other protocols in the guide
- Dependencies and assumptions

## Edge Cases & Gotchas
- Known implementation differences between vendors
- Common misunderstandings
- What the RFC says vs what vendors actually do

## Further Reading
- Definitive books, papers, conference talks
```

## Rules

1. **Vendor neutral** — theory files cover protocol mechanics only. No IOS-XR or Junos configs (those stay in the design files).
2. **RFC anchored** — every claim traces to an RFC or standard. Not just "RFC 5305" but what that RFC actually defines.
3. **IE written exam depth** — you should pass the written from theory files alone.
4. **No code blocks unless showing packet formats** — this isn't a config guide. Packet diagrams and field layouts are fine.
5. **Cross-reference the design file** — theory files should reference their companion design file for "how to actually deploy this."
6. **TTS-friendly** — write for narration. Avoid dense tables where prose works. Code blocks (packet formats) will be skipped by TTS.

## Validation Process

1. Write theory file → commit to repo
2. Jeremy reviews for technical accuracy (he knows these protocols at CCIE/JNCIE depth)
3. Sentinel pass for RFC citation accuracy and factual claims
4. Generate TTS after approval
5. Update checklist below
